I am a master's student at the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. My supervisor is [Prof. Yanlin Wang](https://yanlin.info/) and thank her for her multi-faceted supports. Before going to Sun Yat-sen University, I received the B.S. degree in Electronic Commerce from South China University of Technology in June 2023.

My research interests lie in the fields of Code Intelligence and Large Language Models. I am particularly focused on research related to code completion.
