Introduction
------
I am a master's student at the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. My supervisor is [Prof. Yanlin Wang](https://yanlin.info/) and thank her for her multi-faceted supports. Before going to Sun Yat-sen University, I received the B.S. degree in E-Commerce from South China University of Technology in June 2023.

My research mainly focuses on: **(1) Large Language Model**; **(2) Code Intelligence**.

Educations
------
- **Sun Yat-sen University**  
  M.S. in Software Engineering, August 2023 - Present.

- **South China University of Technology**  
  B.S. in E-Commerce, August 2019 - June 2023.

Publications
------
**RLCoder: Reinforcement Learning for Repository-Level Code Completion**  
<small>**ICSE 2025**  [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19487.pdf) | [Code](https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RLCoder)</small>  
<small>Yanlin Wang, **Yanli Wang**, Daya Guo, Jiachi Chen, Ruikai Zhang, Yuchi Ma, and Zibin Zheng</small>  
<small>**TLDR:** RLCoder is a novel reinforcement learning framework, which can enable the retriever to learn to retrieve useful content for code completion without the need for labeled data, and introduces a stop signal mechanism.</small>
